    <p >The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, allowing scripts to manipulate the content, structure, and style of a document. The DOM provides a way for programs to access and update the content, structure, and style of a document dynamically. It is an essential part of web development, enabling developers to create interactive and dynamic web pages.</p>
